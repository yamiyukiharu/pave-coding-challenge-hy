# Billing API

## Features

1. Create new bills.
2. Add line items to an existing open bill.
3. Close an active bill and get total charged amount.
4. Reject adding line items if a bill is already closed.
5. Query open and closed bills by status and account ID.
6. Retrieve a bill along with all its line items.
